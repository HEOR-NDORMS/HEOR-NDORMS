## Hi there 👋👋🏻👋🏼👋🏽👋🏾👋🏿

### [Health Economics and Outcomes Research (HEOR)](https://www.ndorms.ox.ac.uk/research/research-groups/pinedo-villanueva-group-health-economics-outcomes-research)

We are part of NDORMS, University of Oxford

As a research group, we aim to enhance health and well-being by optimizing health and social care resources. Our research uses real-world data and mathematical models to evaluate the costs and effects of various medical interventions over time, often across a patient’s lifetime. The findings support authorities' decision-making on healthcare funding and provide patients with better information.  

The research focuses on musculoskeletal diseases, particularly osteoporosis, fracture prevention, rare musculoskeletal conditions, and osteoarthritis. It assesses surgical procedures (hip, knee, shoulder, ankle) and post-fracture care programs like Fracture Liaison Services. Additionally, it explores outcome measures to ensure they effectively capture patient benefits and changes over time.
